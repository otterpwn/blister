## Blister
*Blister* is a simple-ish rootkit / kernel driver for Windows that turns user-land processes of the user's choice into [Protected Processes](https://support.kaspersky.com/common/windows/13905).
This can potentially make it more difficult for **some** security software and tools to terminate or modify these processes.

While PPLs can offer some resistance to standard termination attempts, they are not foolproof. Advanced security solutions might still be able to detect and potentially disable them.
There are known techniques used to detect and remove rootkits, including PPL-based ones

*Blister* allows to configure a list of entries for all the processes you would like to be protecter by the driver.
